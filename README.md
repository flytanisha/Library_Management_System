Problem Statement:
Libraries usually house vast quantities of high-quality materials such as books,
journals, and e-books, requiring efficient management of members and recordkeeping for issue and due dates, as well as fines. Manual management of such 
tasks can be burdensome. Therefore, we propose a solution to this problem in the 
form of an SQL-based library management system. This database can significantly 
reduce the challenges and difficulties associated with manual management of 
library materials, including tracking due dates and managing member accounts. 
The proposed solution has the potential to enhance the efficiency of library 
management, improve service delivery, and provide a better experience for library 
users.
